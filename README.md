# Hi, I'm Wishal 👋

### 🚀 Vibe Coder & Product Architect
I don't focus on syntax; I focus on **execution**. I use AI-native workflows to turn high-level ideas into functional products and services at the speed of thought.

- **The Philosophy:** Bringing changes through "vibe coding"—leveraging AI to bridge the gap between imagination and a finished codebase.
- **The Goal:** Building products that solve problems, not just writing lines of code.
